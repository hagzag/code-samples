# 🛠️ Tasks & The code behind the posts

[![Lint Code Base](https://github.com/hagzag/just-do-it/actions/workflows/super-linter.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hagzag/just-do-it/actions/workflows/super-linter.yml) 

This repository was setup to centralize code examples I mention in different blog posts,  
this is part of my attempt to manage all these snippets / samples in once place.

- 🌐 The 1st contribution to this repository was for the post involving `external-dns` - some finishes in the making ;)
- 🚀 The 2nd was the [k3d-intro](./config/tasks/suites/k3d-playground/README.md) is still WIP, it's code was quite useful to me for quite a while ...
  
I hope to to continue maintaining this and making this a table of features.
