# code-samples

This repo was setup to centralize code examples I mention in different blog posts, 
this is part of my attempt to manage all these snippets / samples in once place.

- The 1st contribution to this repo was for the post involving `external-dns` - some finishes in the making ;)
- The 2nd was the [k3d-intro](./posts/k3d-intro/README.md) is still WIP, it's code was quite useful to me for quite a while ...
  
I hope to to continue maintaining this and making this a table of features.
